\caption{\label{tab:}Effect of MFSP on economic-unit level annual fuel consumption.
  The dependent variable is log(fuel consumption). The first two columns use all
  data. Columns 2 and 3 restrict the sample to economic units ``to the left" of
  their subsidy cap, columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to economic units
  ``to the right" of the kink. Since this is a log-linear regression, we must
  exponentiate the coefficient of interest to interpret it. These values are
  shown at the bottom of the table. When subsidized, economic units ``to the
  left" increase their fishing effort by a factor of factor of 2.24, or 124\textbackslash{}\%
  compared to similar unsubsidized fishers (Column 4). We do not find evidence
  that economic units ``to the right" increase their effort.}
