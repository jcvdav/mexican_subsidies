# Main takeaways:

# 2) The difference is greater between always vs never than between sometimes vs never.

# X ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# But, we have more than just treatment status. We know how much each vessel
# received, so we can calculate the elasticity of fishing wrt subsidy. Let's 
# first put things into perspective by calculating the elasticity of fishing wrt
# price of fuel.

# We have annual prices so we have to give up year fixed effects, but we can
# bring in ENSO. From now on, anything that includes log(ph) excludes year fixed
